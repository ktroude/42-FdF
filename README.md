# 42-FdF

The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping.
For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars
is a prerequisite condition to its conquest.
As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic
activity will allow you to better understand these phenomena and their evolution,
and as a result, be better prepared.
It’s your turn today to modelize some 3D magnificent landscapes, imaginary or not.

FDF is short for ’fil de fer’ in French which means ’wireframe model’.

This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges).

Your project must comply with the following rules:
• You must use the MiniLibX. Either the version available on the school machines, or installing it using its sources.
• You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not relink.
• Global variables are forbidden.

External functs accepted:
• open, close, read, write, malloc, free, perror, strerror, exit
• All functions of the math library (-lm compiler option, man man 3 math)
• All functions of the MiniLibX
• ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded
